# Wine-clustering-project


# Project Description

* Construct ML models that predict wine quality scores.
* Use unpervised learning clustering models to derive insights.


# Project Goal
* Predict the quality of wine while incorporating unsupervised learning techniques.
* What are the drivers for quality?
* What are the strongest features to focus on for improving quality
* Present our process and findings to the data science team.


# Steps to Reproduce
1) Clone this repo.
2) Acquire the data from https://data.world/food/wine-quality.
3) Put the data in the file containing the cloned repo.
4) Run notebook.
